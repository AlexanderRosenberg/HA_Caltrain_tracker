# Logo Setup Complete ✅

## What Was Fixed

The logo wasn't showing in HACS because it was only in the integration folder, not in the branding folder where HACS looks for repository logos.

## Logo Locations Created

### 1. Integration Icon (Home Assistant UI)
**Location:** `custom_components/caltrain_tracker/icon.png`
- ✅ Already existed
- Shows in: Settings → Devices & Services
- Shows in: Entity configuration

### 2. HACS Repository Branding
**Location:** `branding/caltrain_tracker/`
- ✅ `icon.png` - Standard logo (256x256)
- ✅ `logo.png` - Repository logo (same file)
- ✅ `icon@2x.png` - Retina display version

## File Details
- **Format:** PNG
- **Size:** 256x256 pixels
- **File size:** ~57KB
- **All three files:** Identical (HACS tries different names)

## How to See the Logo in HACS

**Option 1: Commit and push (Recommended)**
```bash
git add branding/caltrain_tracker/
git commit -m "Add HACS branding logos"
git push
```

Then in Home Assistant:
1. Go to **HACS** → **Integrations**
2. Search for **"Caltrain Tracker"**
3. Logo should appear (may take a few minutes to refresh)

**Option 2: Force HACS refresh**
1. HACS → ⋮ (three dots) → **Reload**
2. Or wait up to 24 hours for automatic refresh

## Where the Logo Shows

**After setup:**
- ✅ HACS integration browser (search results)
- ✅ HACS integration details page
- ✅ Home Assistant Devices & Services page
- ✅ Integration configuration UI

## Verification Checklist

- [x] Icon exists: `custom_components/caltrain_tracker/icon.png`
- [x] Branding folder created: `branding/caltrain_tracker/`
- [x] Icon copied: `branding/caltrain_tracker/icon.png`
- [x] Logo copied: `branding/caltrain_tracker/logo.png`
- [x] Retina version: `branding/caltrain_tracker/icon@2x.png`
- [ ] Files committed to git
- [ ] Changes pushed to GitHub
- [ ] HACS cache refreshed

## Current Status

✅ **Logo files are ready** - just need to commit and push!

```bash
# Run these commands to complete the setup:
cd /Users/alexrosenberg/Documents/Gitrepos/HA_Caltrain_tracker
git add branding/caltrain_tracker/
git add custom_components/caltrain_tracker/icon.png
git commit -m "Add HACS branding logos for integration"
git push
```

## Why Two Locations?

**Integration folder** (`custom_components/caltrain_tracker/`):
- Installed on user's Home Assistant
- Shows in HA UI after installation

**Branding folder** (`branding/caltrain_tracker/`):
- Lives in GitHub repository
- HACS reads it remotely
- Shows in HACS before installation

Both are needed for a complete experience!

## Troubleshooting

**Logo still not showing after 24 hours?**

1. Check GitHub - files must be pushed:
   ```
   https://github.com/AlexanderRosenberg/HA_Caltrain_tracker/tree/main/branding/caltrain_tracker
   ```

2. Clear HACS cache:
   - HACS → ⋮ → Reload
   - Or restart Home Assistant

3. Check file sizes:
   ```bash
   ls -lh branding/caltrain_tracker/
   ```
   All three should be ~57KB

4. Verify PNG format:
   ```bash
   file branding/caltrain_tracker/*.png
   ```
   Should show "PNG image data, 256 x 256"
